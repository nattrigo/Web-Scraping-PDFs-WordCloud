#### *Web Scraping PDFs and Create a Word Cloud from multiple files*

This is a repository with two examples on how to download multiple files from the web and create a word cloud from it.

1.  The python code works with the [Financial Stability Reports](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/fsr/html/all_releases.en.html) available from the European Central Bank.

2.  The R code aims to download the [Economic Bulletin 2021 issues](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/html/all_releases.en.html) available so far by the European Central Bank and later create a word cloud.
